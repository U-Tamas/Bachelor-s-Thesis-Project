For this project to run, you need: 
-Python 3.10 installed
-Tesseract Installed from https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki

Because this application is only able to read from the Pokerstars desktop application, you need 
to download and install it: https://www.pokerstars.ro/
You also need to make an account there to be able to play.
After installing, you need to open the Pokerstars application, and begin begin playing a normal
poker game using play-money, and place the Pokerstars application wholly in the left part of your 
screen.
You must not cover the Pokerstars window, because then the reading won't work.
Please also do not resize the Pokerstars application, as this too can cause the game to be unreadable

After these are done, open the Project in an editor of your choice, and run the main.py file, 
and when the application starts running, just press Start Reading, and enjoy! ;)
